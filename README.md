# Number-Systems

## How it works:

You can declare either your fractions or your integers using the classes that I have implemented and start using the functions.

## How to use this .py:
You can download this file and import it as a module using

```python
import number_systems
```

## Motivation of this file:

This is the place where I have saved my current advance of a final project that I have created to myself to make sure that I have learned all the concepts of 6.0001 from OCW-MIT.
